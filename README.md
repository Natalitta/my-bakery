# User-Experience-Design
## Site-Goals
The site is designed for admin to easily manage the menu and keep track of upcoming bookings.
Also the site provides customers with an opportunity to order what they want and if they'd like a take-away or a delivery on a certain day. Moreover, they can update or cancel their bookings.

## Agile Planning

This project was developed using Agile. All features were assigned to epics and user stories with the labels, Must have, should have, could have. "Must have" user stories were completed first, then "should haves" and finally "could have" ones, so that the site can start functioning as soon as possible.
The Kanban board was created in GitHub projects.
